    COMEDI
    The Linux Control and Measurement Interface

* About Comedi:

Comedi is a collection of drivers for data acquisition hardware.
These drivers work with Linux, and also with Linux combined with
the real-time extensions RTAI and RTLinux.  The Comedi core, which
ties all the driver together, allows applications to be written
that are completely hardware independent.

Comedi supports a variety of data acquisition hardware; an
incomplete list can be found in Documentation/comedi/drivers.txt.

This distribution contains just the Comedi kernel modules.  You will
almost certainly also want to download Comedilib, which is a user
space library, a few utilities, and some example programs.

* Installation:

For installation instructions, look at the file INSTALL.

* Mailing List:

Comedi has a mailing list.  Send "subscribe comedi" to
comedi-request@stm.lbl.gov to subscribe.  Traffic is light, and mainly
questions/answers about comedi installation, bugs, and programming.
General questions about data acquisition are also welcome.
Alternatively, you can subscribe and unsubscribe at
http://stm.lbl.gov/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/comedi.
You can always unsubscribe by sendinging "unsubscribe" (spell
it correctly!) to comedi-request@stm.lbl.gov.

* More Information:

Comedi also has a web page, at http://stm.lbl.gov/comedi.  New versions
of comedi can be found on the ftp site ftp://stm.lbl.gov/pub/comedi.

Often bugfixes and new features that are not in the current release
can be found in the CVS repository.  Instructions for anonymous CVS
access to the Comedi and Comedilib repositories are found at
http://oss.lineo.com/cvs_anon.html.

Comedi may be freely distibuted and modified in accordance with the
GNU General Public License.
