# Comedi installation

NOTE: These instructions are very out-of-date and need to be rewritten
for modern systems.

## Linux source

In order to compile the Comedi modules, you will need to have
a correctly configured Linux kernel source tree.  The best
way to get one is to download a tarball from [kernel.org][1] and
compile your own kernel.  Comedi should work with most 2.2,
2.4, and 2.6 Linux kernels.  2.6.x kernels older than 2.6.6 are
not supported.  Support for 2.0.3x is not actively maintained,
but it should work and bugs will be fixed as they are reported.

You can also prepare a kernel source tree that matches
the kernel you are currently running if you have its config file (in
the Debian distibution the config files for the kernel-image packages
are installed into the *`/boot`* directory).  The following steps will
(almost) set up your kernel sources correctly.  You will also need
write permission to the kernel source directory the first time you
run Comedi's configure script, so you might want to unpack the kernel
source into a directory you own.

1. Get a copy of the kernel source that matches the kernel you are
   running.  Unpack it and copy your kernel config file to *`.config`*
   in the top directory of your kernel source.
2. You might need to edit the file *`Makefile`* in the kernel source.
   At the top of the Makefile, the variable `EXTRAVERSION` is defined.
   If necessary, change it to match your kernel (for example, if the
   command **`uname -r`** produces `2.4.16-386` then your `EXTRAVERSION`
   should be set as `EXTRAVERSION=-386`.
3. Run **`make oldconfig`** in your kernel source directory.
4. Run **`make dep`** (for 2.6 kernels, do a **`make modules_prepare`**
   instead, or even better a full **`make`**) in the kernel source
   directory and you are done.

Red Hat users note: Kernel sources that are distributed with Red
Hat Linux are not supported, because they are too heavily
modified.  However, there is some information in
*`Documentation/comedi/redhat-notes`* on how to use Red Hat kernels.

## RTAI support

If you want to use the real-time capabilities of Comedi with
RTAI, you need to compile and install RTAI first.  If you
don't install the rtai kernel modules, you may get unresolved
symbols when installing the comedi kernel modules.

## RTLinux support

If you want to use the real-time capabilities of Comedi with
RTLinux, you need to compile RTLinux (both the kernel and the
modules) first.  Known working versions are 2.x and 3.0.

## Configuration

Configure with **`./configure`**.  **`./configure --help`** will give
the configuration options.  If the *`configure`* script does not exist
(if you checked comedi out from git for example), it can be generated by
running **`./autogen.sh`**.  The **autoconf**, **automake**,
**autoheader**, etc. tools are required to generate the *`configure`*
script (**automake** version >= 1.7 recommended).  The
**`--with-linuxdir`** option is particularly useful, as it allows you to
specify the location of your Linux kernel source directory.  If you are
using an RT-patched kernel, the **`--with-rtaidir`** or
**`--with-rtlinuxdir`** options allow you to specify the location of
your RTAI or RTLinux source directory.

## Compiling

Compile using **`make`**.  If this fails for some reason, send the
_entire_ build log to the mailing list.  Without the build
log, it is impossible to find problems.

## Installation

Install using **`make install`** as root.  This installs the files:

* *`/lib/modules/${KERNEL_RELEASE}/comedi/comedi.ko`*
* *`/lib/modules/${KERNEL_RELEASE}/comedi/kcomedilib/kcomedilib.ko`*
* *`/lib/modules/${KERNEL_RELEASE}/comedi/drivers/*.ko`*

Comedi communicates with userspace via device files (*`/dev/comedi*`*).
If you have devices which are able to auto-configure themselves and
you've got **udev** support, these devices are created automatically.
You can disable this mechanism by setting the main `comedi` module's
`comedi_autoconfig` parameter to `0` when loading the module. In case
you have got an old ISA card or no **udev** support (embedded systems),
you can create static devices by setting the main `comedi` module's
`comedi_num_legacy_minors` parameter to the number of desired static
*`/dev/comedi*`* devices when loading the module. You can then configure
your device from userspace with **`comedi_config`**. If there is no
**udev** support, you need to create device files to access the hardware
by hand from a user process.  These can be created from the Comedi
build directory using the **`make dev`** command, or by using the
following shell command:

> **`sudo for i in $(seq 0 15); do mknod -m 666 /dev/comedi$i c 98 Si; done`**

The following special files will be created:

* *`/dev/comedi0`*
* *`/dev/comedi1`*
* *`/dev/comedi2`*
* &#8942;
* *`/dev/comedi15`*

## Comedilib

Now would be a good time to compile and install Comedilib.  Comedi and
Comedilib are completely independent, so it doesn't matter which is
installed first.

## Running Comedi

To use Comedi, the driver module and the core Comedi modules must be
loaded into the kernel.  This is done by a command similar to

> **`/sbin/modprobe` _`driver`_**

If your module dependencies are set up correctly, this will load both
`comedi.ko` and your driver module (and possibly other Comedi modules).
If you get unresolved symbols, check the *`FAQ`* or the mailing list
archives.  Also look at the **man** pages for **modprobe** and
**insmod**.

In order to configure a driver module to use a particular device
file (`/dev/comedi`_`N`_) and a particular device, you need to use the
command **`comedi_config`**, which is built from the Comedilib
distribution.  The **`comedi_config`** command is invoked using

> **`comedi_config /dev/comedi0` _`device-name`_ _`option-list`_**

The device name may or may not be the same as the module name.  In
general, if the device type can be autoprobed (as with ISA PnP or
PCI devices), the device name will be the same as the module name.
Otherwise, you will need to check
*`Documentation/comedi/drivers.txt`*[^1] (or *`doc/drivers.txt`* in
Comedilib) for information about what device name is appropriate for
your hardware.  The option list is to supply additional information,
such as I/O address, IRQ, DMA channels, and other jumper settings.
Information about option lists appropriate for a driver is in
drivers.txt.  The following commands are examples:

> **`comedi_config /dev/comedi0 dt2821 0x240,3`**
> <br>
> **`comedi_config /dev/comedi1 ni_atmio 0x260,4`**
> <br>
> **`comedi_config /dev/comedi2 dt2817 0x228`**
> <br>
> **`comedi_config /dev/comedi3 ni_pcimio`**

Try running **`man comedi_config`** for information on how to use
this utility.  Scripts have been written for a few of the drivers
with very complicated option lists.  These may be found in Comedilib's
*`etc`* directory.

## Module Autoloading

For recent kernels, module autoloading is handled by **udev**.  The
following is only applicable to older kernels.

If you like to autoload your modules, put the following lines
into *`/etc/modules.conf`* (this does not apply for PCMCIA cards):

```
alias char-major-98 comedi
alias char-major-98-0 your_driver
post-install your_driver PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH;comedi_config /dev/comedi0 board_name option_list
```

Alternatively, for complicated option lists, the scripts in Comedilib's
*`etc`* are designed to be copied into *`/etc`*, so that you could put
the following lines into *`/etc/conf.modules`*:

```
alias char-major-98-0 dt282x
post-install dt282x /etc/dt282x.conf
```

## Calibration:

If your board has self-calibration capabilities, you will want to run
**comedi_calibrate** (an autocalibration tool that is packaged in a
separate tarball) in a bootup script.

## PCMCIA

The PCMCIA drivers require at least a 2.6.16 kernel (at least for
unpatched mainline kernels).  You must also have **pcmciautils**
and **udev** installed.  You can write a *udev* rule to automatically
run **gpib_config** after the driver is loaded.

## Upgrading

From versions prior to 0.6.0, you will need to edit and recompile
all programs that use Comedi or Comedilib, since the names of
functions and *ioctls* have changed.

From versions prior to 0.5.0, you will need to recompile all programs
that use Comedi or Comedilib, since the interface to both of these has
changed.  No changes should need to be made to the source of the
programs.  The format for parameters of **comedi_config** has changed.

From versions prior to 0.4.0, you will need to run **`make dev`** again
to recreate *`/dev/comedi*`*, since the major number has changed.
