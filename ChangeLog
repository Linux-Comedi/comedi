	  The class_simple interface has been removed - mostly a renaming

	  The s626.c driver needs to use COMEDI_INITCLEANUP_NOMODULE
	  instead of COMEDI_INITCLEANUP because it uses the MODULE_AUTHOR,
	  MODULE_DESCRIPTION and MODULE_LICENSE macros.  I'm not sure why

	* comedi/drivers/: amplc_pc263.c, cb_pcidas.c: patch from
	  abbotti@mev.co.uk (Ian Abbott):

	  At the end of February (or possibly the beginning of March,
	  depending on your timezone!) I submitted a patch to remove
	  pci_find_device and use pci_get_device and pci_dev_put (and
	  occasionally pci_dev_get) instead.

	  I messed up on the amplc_pc262 and cb_pcidas drivers as I forgot
	  to replace pci_find_device with pci_get_device, but added the
	  calls to pci_dev_put, so the PCI reference counts would go
	  negative when the device was detached.  The attached patch
	  corrects this problem and also fixes an unrelated gcc warning in
	  the cb_pcidas driver about a possibly ambiguous 'else' requiring
	  braces (my fault again!).

	* comedi/drivers/: Makefile.am, s626.c, s626.h: Sensoray 626 driver
	  from gpalli@deis.unibo.it (Gianluca Palli):

	  This driver is based on the Sensoray 626 GPL Linux driver

	  The ai_poll function is not yet implemented

	  ao_cmd support is under development

	  The 48 dio channels are divided in to 3 subdev (2,3 and 4) with
	  16 channels (each group of 16 channels is managed by a different
	  hardware registers). These can be grouped in one subdev with 48
	  bit mask. Channels 0-39 can be used as TRIG_EXT arg for ai_cmd
	  (cmd->start_src=TRIG_EXT; cmd->start_arg=20; subdev 3 channel 3
	  is used as external trigger)

	  Encoder/timer device has a lot of configuration option. Now only
	  the encoder configuration is avaiable. If ai_cmd
	  scan_begin_src=TRIG_TIMER or convert_src=TRIG_TIMER are selected,
	  the timer channel 5 and 4 respectively are used as trigger.

	  The code is filled with a lot of debugging messages visible
	  compiling the code with -D_DEBUG_ flag

	  comedi/drivers/rti802.c, include/linux/ioport.h,
	  include/linux/pci.h: Patch from Ian Abbot <abbotti@mev.co.uk>:

	  I've done some work on getting rid of the check_region calls
	  which are now deprecated.

	  I first mentioned this back in March and did a little bit of work
	  on it at the time:

	  https://cvs.comedi.org/pipermail/comedi/2005-March/006971.html
	  https://cvs.comedi.org/pipermail/comedi/2005-March/006977.html

	  My new patch seems to be too large for the comedi mailing list -
	  they just disappear into a black hole, so here is a description
	  of my latest patch:

	  I used a static inline function called compat__request_region and
	  (re)defined a macro called request_region to use it.	The result
	  is that drivers can check the return value of request_region (or
	  pci_request_regions) instead of calling check_region.  Note that
	  the compat__request_region does not return a pointer to anything
	  real, but it can be compared to NULL.

	  The attached patch implements the above compatibility stuff and
	  changes the drivers to use it (but I changed the amplc_pci230
	  driver to use pci_request_regions instead of request_region while
	  I was at it).  I've also changed the compatibility version of
	  pci_request_regions to avoid calling check_regions (otherwise it
	  would be called twice) and also made it release any regions it
	  successfully requested on failure.

	  Most of the changes to the individual drivers were
	  straightforward.  One or two required a modicum of thought to
	  release resources on error.

	  Wiktor Grebla wrote in the comedi mailing list: Somwhere around
	  2.6.9 kernel remap_pfn_range() was introduced as a portable

	  which has dissapeared recently (2.6.11), what resulted in
	  "Unknown symbol" while loading comedi module (and the following
	  ones because of the symbols in it).  I've changed
	  include/linux/mm.h slightly, hopefully without breaking anything.
	  Seems to work. I've tested it with 2.6.10 and 2.6.11.

2005-02-27 15:12  fmhess

	* include/: linux/device.h, pcmcia/ds.h: patch from Ian Abbott
	  <abbotti@mev.co.uk>:

	  The last change to das08_cs.c on Feb 5 breaks on 2.4, though the
	  change itself was not unreasonable (it saves a few bytes at
	  least).  The problem is that the change was incompatible with the
	  version of struct device_driver defined in comedi's
	  linux/device.h compatibility header.	In the "real" version of
	  struct device_driver, the "name" member is a "char *", but in the
	  compatibility version it's a "dev_info_t", which is a "char[32]".

	  The attached patch sorts it out in the compatibility headers.

	* include/: asm/pgtable.h, linux/mm.h: patch from Ian Abbott
	  <abbotti@mev.co.uk>:

	  This patch against CVS also applies to comedi-0.7.69 and allows
	  it to compile correctly against Red Hat 9's 2.4.20-8 kernel, and
	  probably others using the "statm" kernel patch.  It also changes
	  the conditions for defining the pte_offset_kernel() macro in the
	  asm/pgtable.h compatibility header to avoid it being redefined.

2005-02-27 14:05  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_dio200.c: patch from Ian Abbot
	  <abbotti@mev.co.uk>:

	  I think it's probably a bad idea for my amplc_dio200 driver to
	  call comedi_event() while it's holding a spinlock.  The call to
	  comedi_event could call a kcomedilib client's callback function,
	  which might do something that requires the same spinlock, leading
	  to a deadlock.

	  The attached patch moves the calls to comedi_event() to a safe
	  point after the spinlock is released.

2005-02-26 18:15  bporr

	* comedi/drivers/usbduxfast.c: Removed a buffer overflow routine
	  again. The buffer overflow can only be detected in the firmware
	  when 3 out of 4 buffers are full.  Thus, the condition that all 4
	  buffers are full gives already an buffer overflow.

2005-02-21 13:02  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/8253.h: patch from Ian Abbott <abbotti@mev.co.uk>:

	  Here's a couple more minor patches for the
	  i8253_cascade_ns_to_timer_2div function, which I should have
	  spotted earlier.

	  8253_dupcalc.patch gets rid of a duplicate calculation
	  8253_overflow.patch adds some arithmetic overflow checks to the
	  "early exit" test.

	* comedi/drivers/: amplc_pc236.c, comedi_parport.c: patch from	Ian
	  Abbott <abbotti@mev.co.uk>:

	  This patch sets the COMEDI_CB_BLOCK event in the interrupt
	  routines of the comedi_parport and amplc_pc236 drivers, as
	  whatever is monitoring the interrupts probably wants to know
	  about them as soon as possible!

	  <abbotti@mev.co.uk>:

	  Here's an asm/semaphore.h compatibility header to help build
	  Comedi drivers for kernel versions prior to 2.2.18.  It defines
	  the following missing macros:

	  init_MUTEX(x) init_MUTEX_LOCKED(x) DECLARE_MUTEX(name)
	  DECLARE_MUTEX_LOCKED(name)

	  I didn't define sema_init(sem, val) as I the implementation is
	  arch-dependent.

2005-02-17 14:48  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/8253.h: patch from Ian Abbott <abbotti@mev.co.uk>:

	  This patch improves the "early exit" test in the

	  to take account of a divisor of 65536 being represented by 0.

2005-02-08 17:53  fmhess

	* include/linux/sched.h: patch from Ian Abbott <abbotti@mev.co.uk>:

2005-02-07 15:36  bporr

	* comedi/drivers/usbduxfast.c: Added proper insn command with a

	* include/linux/sched.h: fix for need_resched from Ian Abbott
	  <abbotti@mev.co.uk>:

	  This patch alters the Comedi driver's linux/sched.h compatibility
	  header to move the need_resched function after the #include_next
	  directive.  This is because the 'current' task variable is not
	  defined until after the real linux/sched.h is included.  I've
	  also removed the comment - "/* not sure exactly when
	  need_resched() was added */"; I've checked, and it was added in
	  2.4.20 as the code stated.  I thought I'd fix the incorrect
	  comment at the top of the file while I was at it.

	* comedi/drivers/: amplc_pc236.c, amplc_pc263.c: patch from Ian
	  Abbott <abbotti@mev.co.uk>, who says:

	  This patch fixes a harmless logical error in the _attach routines
	  of the amplc_pc236 and amplc_pc263 drivers that I noticed while
	  looking at the pci_for_each_dev stuff.  Also, now that the
	  drivers ar using pci_find_device instead of pci_for_each_dev, the
	  patch offloads some of the searching for a matching PCI device to
	  the pci_find_device function.

	  The bug is just after the loop that finds the PCI device ID table
	  entry that matches the comedi board name.  The test for reaching
	  the end of the PCI device ID table without finding a match was
	  incorrect.  I say the bug is harmless because there would have to
	  be another bug somewhere else to trigger this bug.

	* comedi/drivers/usbdux.c:
	  From kernel version 2.6.10 the function usb_kill_urb has to be

	  much safer, in particular when the user unplugs the device while
	  it is transmitting data.  Also added some comments to the debug
	  defines.

2005-01-03 09:22  bporr

	* comedi/drivers/usbduxfast.c:
	  Switched from iso transfer to bulk transfer. ISO is not the right

	* comedi/drivers/ni_at_ao.c: Fixed bugs reported by
	  csp@andrew.cmu.edu.  The bug report was as follows:

	  I have been attempting to get a NI-ATAO10, a 10 channel legacy
	  ISA analog output board, working with comedi. Apparantely the way
	  comedi_from_phys works to convert voltage to sample doesn't seem
	  to work correctly with the ATAO10 board.  I found that the
	  correct sample data for the ATAO10 board is as follows:

	  In unipolar mode 0V = 2048 +10V = 6143

	  In bipolar mode -10V = 2048 +10V = 6143

	  It seems that comedi_from_phys is somehow shifted by 2048 from
	  what it should be (comedi_from_phys gives values from 0 to 4095).

	  Furthermore, comedi does not detect the polarity of the board
	  (I'm not sure if this is possible on this board); thus the range
	  is always reported as -10V to +10V even if the board is set on
	  unipolar mode (which is achieved by setting jumpers on the
	  board).

	  Finally, for some reason, channel 0 does not work with Comedi
	  (the board fully works in Windows). The other 9 channels work.

	* include/linux/usb.h:
	  The memory allocation flag GFP_KERNEL is not permissible in an

	  with no irq

2004-08-18 15:36  bporr

	* comedi/drivers/usbdux.c: The submission of the bulk transfers can
	  be delayed. This leads in the worst case to a change in the order
	  of bulk transfers. For example, the insn command requests the
	  counter value. After that another insn requests the status of the
	  digital port. It happens that these requests are swapped in their
	  temporal order because the USB controller might delay a
	  submission because of heavy traffic. The linux kernel _assumes_
	  that the packet has been sent. In fact this can't be guaranteed.
	  Therefore now the packet which is sent from the firmware is
	  checked. If it is the wrong one it is requested again.

	* comedi/drivers/: ni_atmio.c, ni_mio_common.c, ni_mio_cs.c,
	  ni_pcimio.c, ni_stc.h: add support for comedi_poll when using

	  interrupt handler).

2004-03-21 09:11  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/ni_mio_common.c: wake on end of scan based on

2004-03-20 05:32  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/usbdux.c: usbdux driver update from Bernd Porr:

	  This patch resolves problems with buggy VIA/SIS USB controllers.
	  They tend to loose IRQs in high speed mode. In the 2.6.4 kernel
	  there's now a watchdog timer which triggers an interrupt after
	  5ms. To make this safely work with the usbdux driver the number
	  of buffers has been increased to 10 for the high speed mode and
	  to 5 for the full speed mode.  There are also some minor changes:
	  removed unnecessary defines and removed the text that firmware
	  upload through comedi is deprecated. In fact some distros have
	  fxload not installed so that comedi itself has (still) to do the
	  job.

	  Had to change the USB 2.0 transfer protocol from IRQ transfer to
	  ISO transfer.  Reason: IRQ transfer is still not stable
	  (2.4/2.6). However, ISO transfer has been rewritten in the kernel
	  and works (just now in 2.6 but will be backported sooner or
	  later)! I supply new firmware and a new version of the driver
	  which now uses ISO transfer throughout (1.1 / 2.0).

	  Fixed two bogus samples on first command using external queue by
	  moving queue setup to a later point in ai cmd.  Moved around some
	  code in attach() so more stuff gets done before interrupt handler
	  is registered (due to one crash I saw while modprobing while
	  sound card on same interrupt was playing).

	  duplicate kernel flags. Fix scripts/dep.* to not add to CFLAGS if
	  the RTAI/RTLinux include directories don't exist.  (Might not be

2001-05-18 21:15  fmhess

	* comedi/comedi_ksyms.c, comedi/drivers/comedi_rt_timer.c,
	  include/linux/comedi_rt.h: exported rt_pend_call() so that
	  comedi_rt_timer can be configured multiple times

2001-05-18 12:25  timousley

	* comedi/drivers/: mite.c, ni_mio_common.c: MITE DMA data is now
	  unsigned short instead of twos complement.  Also fixed bug where
	  the ISR would try to poll the STC fifo instead of letting the
	  MITE retrieve the data.

2001-05-15 21:58  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/comedi_rt_timer.c: improved error handling a bit

2001-05-15 13:07  timousley

2001-05-13 16:41  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/comedi_rt_timer.c: bug fixes, analog output
	  commands work now!  Added scan_begin_src==TRIG_FOLLOW,
	  convert_src==TRIG_TIMER.  TRIG_RT flag was causing null
	  dereferences, that is fixed now from user space, but NOT when
	  command is called from kernel space.

2001-05-13 11:19  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/poc.c: fixed bug due to typo

2001-05-11 17:00  fmhess

	  read and possibility of never becoming_nonbusy

2001-05-11 16:24  fmhess

	  to redefine rt_get_time() which still called broken HRT_TO_8254()
	  function.

2001-05-11 13:18  timousley

	* comedi/drivers/: mite.c, ni_mio_common.c, ni_stc.h: MITE does
	  continuous AI now.  Fixed bug so MIO cards can go 1.25MS/s.
	  Fixed some assorted MITE bugs.

2001-05-11 09:00  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/comedi_rt_timer.c: nano2tick_hack() now gives

	  chanlist, hopefully this will also fix the occasional segfaults

2001-05-10 09:47  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/comedi_rt_timer.c: fixed clearing of async->events

2001-05-10 09:41  timousley

	* comedi/drivers/ni_mio_common.c: ni_ai_setup_MITE_dma() now
	  configures MITE for correct # of bytes. mite interrupt handler
	  now stops blocking when the MITE transfers a chunk of data.
	  handle_a_interrupt() does not stop the MITE prematurely (when STC
	  generates a SC.TC. interrupt)

2001-05-10 08:30  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/comedi_rt_timer.c: fixed a bug I created, noticed
	  that commands only work right the first try.	Second try command
	  seems to start, then abort after 1 or a few samples then (from
	  /proc/interrupts) start again and finish.

2001-05-10 03:18  ds

	* comedi/drivers/: ni_mio_common.c, ni_stc.h: minor cleanups

2001-05-04 16:32  fmhess

	* comedi/comedi_fops.c, include/linux/comedi_rt.h: restored include
	  of comedidev.h from comedi_rt.h so that spin locks can be used
	  through including comedi_rt.h instead of having to go through
	  comedidev.h.	This include was originally removed due to circular
	  dependence between comedidev.h and comedi_rt.h but they're just
	  header files so it doesn't seem to matter.
