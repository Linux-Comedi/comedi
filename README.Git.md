# Building Comedi from Git

Building Comedi from Git, or from an archive generated by Git, is
slightly different from building from a distribution tarball. There is
an additional step of creating the *configure* script and makefiles from
the templates using **automake**, **autoconf**, etc.  This is all done
automatically by running the script: `./autogen.sh`.

You may need to edit the *autogen.sh* script so that it runs the
appropriate commands.  Often, the necessary commands have version
suffixes.  Occasionally, for strange reasons, errors can be
solved by running `./autogen.sh` twice.

Requirements:

* automake >= 1.6
* autoconf >= 2.64
